.. rubric:: Design Goals

* Clearly named classes that model the semantics of an EDA project.
* Child objects shall have a reference to their parent.


.. rubric:: Overall Hierarchy

An EDA project contains one or multiple variants of a EDA design.
A design then has at least one but usually multiple file sets to group source files and apply settings or attributes to that group.
